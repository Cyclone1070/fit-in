All objects that are interacted with MUST be identified and placed as elements in either the 'targets' or 'using' arrays.",

This field can be as short as a single verb or as long and complex as a detailed instruction. A critical rule is that this field MUST be isolated from the nouns that belong in the 'target' and 'with' fields. Its value must not contain the name of the target or the instrument being used. For example, for a command like 'hit the zombie with a stick', the correct value for 'action' is 'hit powerfully'. For a complex command like 'write down 'hello world' in latin for your future self', the value is 'write down 'hello world' in latin for my future self'."
